TODO
====

- figure out how to drag all of the header stuff out of SK for
  analytics etc but without the stylesheets 
  (and what to do with JS that is for their site?)
  meta description etc relevant too
- prevent double convert-to-scrollkit
- security
- be able 'revert to non-scroll'
- handle api key (SK side needs to response appropriately too) denials and that stuff

- google web fonts
- fonts that are on SK's server but not ours? (might work since the stylesheet is ours)
- figure out how to kill the connection after getting pinged and then keep
  doing work
- make clear to users that when they edit wp post, they aren't updating the scroll
- deal w/ old versions of WP


SECURITY
========
