TODO
====

- prevent double convert-to-scrollkit
- security
- be able 'revert to non-scroll'
- handle api key (SK side needs to response appropriately too) denials and that stuff

- google web fonts
- fonts that are on SK's server but not ours? (might work since the stylesheet is ours)
- figure out how to kill the connection after getting pinged and then keep
  doing work
- make clear to users that when they edit wp post, they aren't updating the scroll
- deal w/ old versions of WP


SECURITY
