TODO
====

- work with user's caches (i.e. trigger a post 'update' or something)
- figure out how to kill the connection after getting pinged and then keep
  doing work
- handle the case where a user deletes the post on scrollkit
- images (and other media) that could be in a wordpress post
- handle case where api key has been updated on wordpress' side, but the 
  user is editing an existing post

- deal w/ old versions of WP

SK SIDE:
  handle logged out users correctly when they try to edit a post

DESIGNY
=======
(on sk)
- make it more clear how to generate an api key or get to that url
- make api key page nicer
- remind users what variables need to be in the header and footer

SECURITY
========

Main plugin file should be the same name as plugin directory. 
I'd make the Github repo `scrollkit` and rename 'index.php' to 'scrollkit.php'

scroll-api.php should instead use admin ajax:
http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins
Right now your code allows anyone to update any post,
which is pretty much a horrible idea. You need to have some type
of authentication mechanism such that WordPress will only accept requests from 
Scroll Kit. Same thing applies for user-api.php

- Any foreign data should be safely sanitized before use:
  http://codex.wordpress.org/Validating_Sanitizing_and_Escaping_User_Data

Also, the lightbox thing is annoying and seems broken. It would be better to
fit all of that functionality into the post meta box.
