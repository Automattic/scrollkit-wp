SECURITY
========

we are putting unescaped content into their site

the site trusts that what is in those 'custom fields' is trustworthy and not
some bad javascript or something. if an author can edit those custom fields,
anyone with author level privilege can open up an xss. this is why wordpress
strips out javascript from posts, but we need to include js somehow

keep an eye on this:
