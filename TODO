TODO
====

- send paragraphs and line breaks to SK
- google web fonts
- figure out how to drag all of the header stuff out of SK for
  analytics etc but without the stylesheets 
  (and what to do with JS that is for their site?)
  meta description etc relevant too
- fonts that are on SK's server but not ours? (might work since the stylesheet is ours)
- prevent double convert-to-scrollkit
- figure out how to kill the connection after getting pinged and then keep
  doing work
- security
- make post uneditable
- be able 'revert to non-scroll'
- handle api key (SK side needs to response appropriately too) denials and that stuff
- deal w/ old versions of WP


SECURITY
========

we are putting unescaped content into their site

the site trusts that what is in those 'custom fields' is trustworthy and not
some bad javascript or something. if an author can edit those custom fields,
anyone with author level privilege can open up an xss. this is why wordpress
strips out javascript from posts, but we need to include js somehow

keep an eye on this:
