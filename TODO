====

- try installing on a fresh wp
- sometimes 500s or times out when loading a scroll
- save draft prompt if it's not published or saved
- make request flows more sane (less exit statements 3 method calls in)
- handle the case where a user deletes the post on scrollkit
- deal w/ old versions of WP
- link to js and css assets in an s3 bucket (or inline it to be simple) so sk
  downtime doesn't effect wp installs
- images (and other media) that could be in a wordpress post
